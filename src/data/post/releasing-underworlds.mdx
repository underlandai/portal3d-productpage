## What is Underworlds?

[Underworlds](https://underworlds.com) is a resource intelligence platform designed to connect mining and exploration projects with the capabilities of cloud-based, high-performance computing. The initial release, Underworlds v1.0, focuses on providing secure, rapid, web-based sharing and visualisation of 3D resource models utilising the industry-standard Open Mining Format (OMF). Our objective is to streamline collaboration on complex 3D project data, moving beyond the limitations of PDF documents and local workstations.

## Who is Underworlds for?

Underworlds is engineered for a diverse range of professionals within the resources industry who require the ability to share, view, and collaborate on 3D resource models. This includes:

* Geologists
* Consultants
* Mining Engineers
* Project Managers
* Investors
* Teams within small to medium-sized resource companies
* Large organisations with complex resource modelling requirements
* Local community stakeholders

## How does Underworlds work?

Underworlds streamlines your workflow into three straightforward steps:

1.  **Step 1: Export & Upload:** Export your Open Mining Format (OMF) file from your existing mining software and upload the 3D subsurface model through our secure web interface.
2.  **Step 2: Verify Ownership:** Create a complimentary account to verify ownership of the model and configure access controls.
3.  **Step 3: Visualise & Share:** Visualise your interactive 3D model and distribute it to stakeholders using a unique, secure URL.

## Key Capabilities of Underworlds v1.0

* **High-Performance Visualisation:** Explore intricate subsurface models directly in your web browser. Our AWS High-Performance Computing (HPC) backend ensures a fluid, interactive 3D experience, removing the dependency on specialised software or powerful local workstations.
* **Instant Collaboration:** Securely share complex data and interactive 3D subsurface models with stakeholders instantaneously via a unique link.
* **Total Data Control:** Maintain complete data sovereignty with secure hosting on AWS. Enterprise clients have the option of a fully self-hosted solution.
* **Broad Compatibility:** Underworlds integrates with your existing software workflows. Export OMF files with ease from leading packages such as Leapfrog, Deswik, Maptek Vulcan, Micromine, GEOVIA, and Geosoft.
* **Global Reach, Low Latency:** By leveraging AWS's global infrastructure, we serve your models from data centres located near your stakeholders, ensuring optimal load times worldwide.
* **API Access:** Integrate Underworlds into your workflows with API access for programmatic control, available on our Enterprise plan.
* **Dedicated Support:** Our team is available to assist with integration, deployment, and scaling to meet your operational requirements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some common questions about Underworlds. If you cannot find the information you require, please [contact](/contact) our support team.

### Data Security & Hosting

* **Where is my data stored?**
    We prioritise your data sovereignty. Your data is **never** stored on our own servers. All data is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's leading cloud platform. This provides robust security, reliability, and allows your data to be stored in specific geographic regions to meet compliance needs.

* **Who has access to my subsurface models?**
    You maintain full control. Only users you explicitly grant access to can view or interact with your subsurface models via secure, time-limited links and role-based access controls.

### Enterprise & Integration

* **Can we host our own data?**
    Yes. For organisations with strict data residency or internal governance requirements, our Enterprise plan offers a self-hosted option. You can deploy the Underworlds visualisation platform within your own cloud environment, giving you complete control.

* **Do you provide an API?**
    Yes, our Enterprise plan includes API access. The API allows you to programmatically upload models, manage projects, and embed the Underworlds 3D viewer directly into your company's internal applications, websites, or data platforms.

### Processing & Performance

* **How long will it take for my subsurface model to be processed?**
    Thanks to our AWS High-Performance Computing (HPC) backend, most subsurface models are ready within a few minutes. However, processing time can occasionally take longer depending on the size and complexity of your data (up to 1TB) and current platform demand. We're constantly optimising our processing pipeline for speed.

* **Do you support any file formats besides OMF?**
    Yes! We're excited to announce that **GeoH5 support is expected to launch next week!** While OMF is our primary format, we are actively developing support for others. We plan to add support for VTK, GOCAD, CSV, and OBJ files in the future. If you have a specific format need, please ask!
