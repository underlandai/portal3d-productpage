## What is CoreSync?

[CoreSync](https://coresync.dev) is a Commodity Resource Intelligence Platform connecting resource projects with the power of cloud-based, high-performance computing. CoreSync v1.0 launches with **secure, rapid, web-based sharing and visualization of 3D resource models** in the industry-standard Open Mining Format (OMF). We're making it easier than ever to collaborate on complex project data, moving beyond static screenshots and PDFs.

## Who is CoreSync for?

CoreSync is designed for a wide range of users in the resource industry who need to share, view, and collaborate on 3D resource models, including:

*   Geologists
*   Consultants
*   Mining engineers
*   Project managers
*   Investors
*   Teams within small to medium-sized resource companies
*   Large organizations with complex resource modeling requirements
*   Local community members

## Key Benefits of Using CoreSync v1.0

*   **Instant, Secure Sharing:** Share your 3D models instantly with a simple, secure URL. No downloads or specialized software are required for viewers. (Available on Professional, Team, and Enterprise plans)
*   **Interactive 3D Visualization:** Explore your resource models directly in your browser with intuitive controls.
*   **Democratize Insights:** Empower everyone on your team, and external stakeholders, to gain valuable insights from your 3D data.
*   **Drive Down Costs:** Improve efficiency and reduce communication overhead by centralizing your 3D model sharing.
*   **Broad Compatibility:** Works with data from leading resource modeling software (Seequent Leapfrog Geo, Deswik, Micromine, Datamine, Dassault Syst√®mes 3DEXPERIENCE, and Mira Geoscience).
*   **Rapid Processing:** Models are typically processed and ready for sharing within a couple of hours.
*   **Secure Data Management:** Industry-standard encryption protects your data at rest and in transit.
*   **Easy Uploading:** A streamlined process for managing multiple models.
*   **Role-Based Access Control:** Control who can view and interact with your models (available on Team and Enterprise plans).
*   **Responsive Support:** Our dedicated team is here to help.

## Use Cases

CoreSync streamlines various workflows, including:

*   **Drilling Program Updates:** Keep stakeholders informed with interactive 3D visualizations of drilling progress.
*   **Consultant-Client Collaboration:** Share geoscientific models with clients, eliminating the need for large file transfers and ensuring everyone is on the same page.
*   **Cross-disciplinary Internal Collaboration:** Facilitate real-time collaboration on 3D models among geologists, engineers, and planners, even across geographically distributed teams.
*   **M&A Due Diligence:** Securely share project data with potential investors.
*   **Community Engagement:** Simplify complex project explanations for local communities with clear, interactive 3D models.

## How does CoreSync work?

1.  **Upload:** Upload your OMF file through our secure interface.
2.  **Process:** CoreSync leverages high-performance computing to process your data and optimize it for web-based 3D visualization.
3.  **Visualize:** Interact with your 3D model directly in your browser.
4.  **Share:** Generate a secure, shareable URL to instantly share your model with anyone (Professional, Team, and Enterprise plans).
5.  **Manage:** Control access to your models with role-based permissions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Sharing & Collaboration

*   **How can I share my 3D model with others?**
    *   On paid plans (Professional, Team, and Enterprise), CoreSync provides a unique, shareable URL once your model is processed. Anyone with this link can view your model in their web browser without needing a CoreSync account.
*   **Can I collaborate with my team on projects?**
    *   Yes! Our Team and Enterprise plans include collaboration features, allowing multiple users to access and work on the same projects. Role-based access control lets you manage permissions.
*   **Is sharing available on the Free plan?**
    *   The Free plan allows you to view models shared with you, but it does not include the ability to generate shareable URLs for your own uploaded models.

### Processing & Performance (No significant changes)

*   **How long does processing take?**
    *   Most models are ready within a couple of hours, but it can take up to 24 hours depending on data size/complexity and platform demand.
*   **My model is still processing after a while. What should I do?**
    *   If processing exceeds 24 hours, [contact](/contact) our support team.

### Data Security (No significant changes)

*   **How secure is CoreSync?**
    *   Data security is our top priority. CoreSync uses industry-standard encryption (TLS 1.2 for data in transit and AES-256 for data at rest), secure Digital Ocean infrastructure, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions. Our security team has 24/7 on-call coverage.
* **Who has access to my models?**
    * Only users you explicitly grant access to can view or interact with your models. You maintain full control over your data.

### Supported Data & File Formats

*   **What data types can I visualize from an OMF file?**
    *   CoreSync handles various geoscience data: point data, curve data, surface data, drillholes, geophysical data, and 3D models.
*   **Do you support other file formats besides OMF?**
    *   Yes! VTK, GEOH5, GOCAD, CSV, and OBJ support is planned for release in Q2 2025.
